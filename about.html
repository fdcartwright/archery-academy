                    <p> Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer
                        himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has
                        three children, and started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the
                        archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies came out,
                        he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the
                        business has been booming ever since.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> Giap tells you that people who use the site are mostly current and prospective students. They're
                        interested in learning about the facilities and services available, as well as being reminded of
                        the class schedule and location.
